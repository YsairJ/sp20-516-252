## Facebook's Data Center at Los Lunas, NM 
 
A new data center by Facebook was open in early 2019 in Los Lunas, New Mexico after two years of construction with an investment of 1 billion dollars. Only one of six buildings has been completed so far and the construction will last till 2023.

This data center is placed in the desert and will have six buildings for data storage. Each of the buildings has multiple “data halls,” or darkened rooms to store dozens of rows of towering servers. These servers store media posted by 2.3 billion users around the world “in the cloud,” such as photos and videos, on social networks including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Each building is about the size of four football fields. After completion, there will be 22 “data halls” in total. The first floor of the finished building is for data storage, similar to a library with shelves storing packs of 8-track cassette-size hard drives. Every six-pack can store about two billion photos. The ventilation for hard drives and cooling system are on the second floor to filter out dust and wind particles.

Facebook strives to build this data center as one of the most energy-efficient data centers in the world and aims to have all the operations powered by renewable energy by 2020. Specifically, this data center has a 10-megawatt solar farm nearby, one of the eight to be built in New Mexico as part of a 396-megawatt system to power the data center with 100% renewable energy. The other projects for power sources include a solar array, two wind farms and some solar facilities. The center uses 38 percent less electricity and is 80 percent more efficient in water usage than the industry average.

In the year of 2018, this data center has used 26,000 MWh electricity, had
 operation emissions of 1,000 metric tons of CO2 and a location-based
  greenhouse gas emission of 12,000 metric tons of CO2. Twenty-five thousand
   cubic meters of water have been used to keep the office running and to
    cool the data center[@sp20-516-252-apnews][@sp20-516-252-krqe][@sp20-516-252-lcsun-news][@sp20-516-252-news-bulletin][@sp20-516-252-abqjournal][@sp20-516-252-facebook-sustainability].

## Hydroelectric Energy

Hydroelectric energy is a type of renewable, clean energy that uses power by
 water to generate electricity. When water flows down from a higher place
 , the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which can be used
  to spin the blades of a turbine to generate electricity. Hydropower is the
   most common renewable source of electricity and contributes to the
    majority of renewable electricity power generated around the world. There
     are many data centers powered by hydroelectric energy, including
      Facebook’s data center in Lulea, Sweden, Google’s data center in Hamina
      , Finland, and Volkswagen’s data center in Rjukan, Norway. Volkswagen’s
       data center is 100% powered by hydropower [@sp20-516-252-hydroelectric-energy][@sp20-516-252-green-biz][@sp20-516-252-google-data-center][@sp20-516-252-water-power].

## China's Renewable Energy Efforts

China has put much energy and investment into the development of the renewable energy sector in the last two decades. Currently, China is the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy, and the largest domestic and outbound investor in renewable energy. As of 2017, five out of the six largest solar module manufacturing companies and the largest wind turbine manufacturer are owned by China. China is also one of the major countries in electricity production from renewable energy sources. Despite its largest installed capacity in hydro, solar and wind power, these renewable sources have only provided 24% of electricity generation due to the country’s huge energy needs for economic development. But China strives to increase its portion of non-fossil energy usage and has passed several relevant domestic policies.
By 2030, one-fifth of China's domestic electricity consumption is forecasted to come from non-fossil fuel sources.

Such investments in renewable energy have brought many positive impacts to
 Chinese society, including reliving air and water pollutions, and reducing
  the risks of socio-economic instability and its dependency on foreign
   energy sources. Fossil fuel energy production and consumption is the cause
    of 90% of the country’s sulfur dioxide emissions, according to the
     National People’s Congress’(NPC) Environmental Committee, and 7 out of
      10 most polluted cities around the world are in China. Such pollutions
       have led to serious economic and health consequences, including an
        estimated 6.5 percent of GDP and 17 percent of deaths in the country
        . An increase in the usage of renewable energy helps to reduce
         pollutions. Such development in the sector also creates more economic opportunities. The National Energy Administration (NEA) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) plans to spend more than $360 billion on developing renewable energy, which will lead to 13 million new jobs in the sector by 2020. Additionally, renewable energy provides China with more independence from foreign energy sources.Since China has been importing much of the coal and cruel oils from its neighboring countries to meet its energy demand for economic growth, the generation and use of domestically generated clean energy allow China to be less affected by the global energy market [@sp20-516-252-wikipedia][@sp20-516-252-csis][@sp20-516-252-china-power].

## Data Center Outages

A power surge broke down the data center at the Heathrow Airport and caused the failure of its messaging system in 2017 due to a simple human operational error. As a consequence, British Airways (BA) canceled more than 400 flights and strand 75000 passengers in one day because of the mistake. In one day, British Airways owners lost 170 million GBP, and the company shares fell by 4% as its reputation was damaged. Specifically, BA canceled all the department flights at Heathrow and Gatwick airports when check-in and operating systems crashed. Flights on Sunday and Monday are also affected. More than 50,000 people had been rebooked on to more than 30 different airlines.

Similarly, a mistyped command line by an Amazon engineer caused a four-hour
 AWS outage in 2017. Many popular web services, including Coursera, Medium
 , Quora, Slack, Docker, Expedia and AWS cloud health status dashboard, were
  affected. Other businesses that relied on S3 were also affected, such as
   mobile banking applications by credit unions. Amazon lost an estimate of
    150 million dollars during the outage and an additional 160 million
     dollars by US financial services companies [@sp20-516-252-network-world][@sp20-516-252-the-guardian][@sp20-516-252-data-center-knowledge].
